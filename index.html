<h1>Book: Mrs.Smith's Spy School<em> For Girls</em> Double Cross</h1>
<img src= "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51JHLz333eL._SY346_.jpg">
<h2>Characters</h2>
<p>The characters I chose for my website are the five main characters the story focuses on. The story centers around Abigail Hunter, the daughter of Jennifer Hunter, one of the founders of the spy school.
The antagonist is Poppy Parsons, Mrs. Smith favors her and is willing to let Poppy into spy school early, causing Abby and her friends to be jealous.
Abby has three BFFs, Toby, Charlotte, and Izumi. I will be doing a page on this website on each of them separately.</p>

<h1>This is a picture of Abby.</h1>
<p> Abby is a very consistent girl, she doesn't every give up. Even though Abby is somewhat clumsy and managed to break serveral spy phones, it isn't totally her fault. Abby is the Ghost and "Tinker Bells"
 number one target, making her very vulnerable. The Ghost and Tinker Bell are also enemies, they both want to control the world and be the most feared hacker on earth.</p>
 <p> It wasn't very difficult finding Abby five website links, as her personality is truly one of a kind. Below are the links to the websites, please don't click on the links(unless you are Mrs.Stoffberg 
 or Mr.Cupit). <strong>Thank you.</strong></p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature"><em>Nature</em></a>
<p>I chose this website on Nature because Abby loves the wild enviroment, and getting to know it; just like her mother.</p>
<a href="https://www.cariboutests.com/test/practice_test_login.php"><em>Caribou Contests</em></a>
<p>I chose this website because Abby loves math, it's her favorite subject in school.</p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis"><em>Cannabis</em></a>
<p>I think Abby would enjoy learning about Cannabalism beacuse she cares about others.</p>
<a href="https://www.tripadvisor.ca/Restaurant_Review-g154943-d3320819-Reviews-The_Notte_s_Bon_Ton_Bakery-Vancouver_British_Columbia.html"><em>Bon Ton Bakery Trip Advisor</em></a>
<p>Abby's a real foodie, so I think she will enjoy a visit to Bon Ton Bakery.</p>
<a href="https://www.thedailymeal.com/eat/10-best-all-you-can-eat-buffets-america"><em>14 Best Buffets</em></a>
<p>I think this is a good website for Abby because again. she loves food.</p>

<title>Poppy Parsons</title>
<body>

<h1>Unfortunatly, I wasn't able to find a picture of Poppy. You are welcome to search it up yourself.</h1>
<p>Poppy was harder to find website links for as she had a more snobby personality. She was quite the genius and loved to plan. Poppy was the creater of Blackout, a device that can shut down electricity 
anywhere, anytime. Blackout was designed to stop people who annoy Poppy from doing so, but became a dangerous weapon. At first, Abby, Izumi, Charlotte, and Toby thought the Ghost was after Blackout, so they had
to work together with Poppy and tell her eveything to <strong><em>"Save the world."</em></strong></p>
<p>Again, I'm going to ask you not to click on the links unless you're the teacher, Thank You.</p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_awards"><em>Awards you can win</em></a>
<p>I chose this website because Poppy loved to earn rewards, she always wanted to make her parents proud.</p>
<a href="https://managementhelp.org/strategicplanning/index.htm"><em>Strategic Planning.</em></a>
<p>Poppy loves being organized and pays close attention to details. One thing she loves doing most is planning. I think she'll enjoy this website and maybe learn something from it.</p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"><em>Science.</em></a>
<p>As snobby as Poppy was, she was quite the nerd. Her favorite subject would be Science; and that's why I think Poppy would enjoy this link.</p>
<a href="https://list25.com/25-most-expensive-things-in-the-world/"><em>Top 25 most expensive things you can buy.</em></a>
<p>The reason I chose this link is because not only was Poppy smart, her parents were <em>really</em> rich. If Poppy got awarded with something, who knows how much cash she'll get!</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=new+viral+fashion+trends+2019"><em>New Viral Fashion Trends</em></a>
<p>I chose this link because Poppy always dressed up-to-date, so maybe these kinds of websites help her.</p>

<h1>I wasn't able to find a picture of just Charlotte, but as you can see above, the blond girl behind Abby is Charlotte.</h1>
<p>I'm unsure of what Charlotte's favorite subject is, and all I know is that Charlotte loved fashion.Charlotte might be the hardest one of them all create links for</p>
<p>Again, I'm going to ask you not to click on the links unless you're the teacher, Thank You.</p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fashion_magazines"><em>Fashion Magazines list</em></a>
<p>I chose this website because Charlotte loved Fashion, and I think she will enjoy reading some of the magazines listed in the link.</p>
<a href="https://twitter.com/nordstrom"><em>Nordstrom's twitter link</em></a>
<p>I know that Nordstrom would probably be Charlotte's dream store, and she might want to follow them on twitter!</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Viral+hair+trends"><em>Viral hair trends</em></a>
<p>I think Charlotte would want to keep up the latest hair, wouldn't she?</p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making"><em>Decision-making</em></a>
<p>Charlotte isn't the best at making good decisions, so hopefully this link will help her.</p>
<a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/83068/4-effective-fighting-techniques-that-every-man-should-know"><em>Quick fighting techniques</em></a>
<p>Charlotte is an exellent fighter, and I think she will apreciate these tips.</p>

<img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51JHLz333eL._SY346_.jpg"width= 225 height= 375>
<h1>I was also unable to find a picture of just Toby, but in the picture above, you can see Abby in the front, and Toby and the left side of Abby.</h1>
 <p>Toby was easy to ifnd website links for, because of his to invent and love for science. Even though Toby loved to create, some of his things, don't turn out well. For example, Toby created a cookie
 app that was designed to send the smell of cookies through a phone. But because of some error in the code, it ended up almost poisioning him. "The Cookie App" turned out to be the thing The Ghost was 
 after; that's how dangerous it was.</p>
<p>Again, I'm going to ask you not to click on the links unless you're the teacher, Thank You.</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRWRmIEHr3A"><em>Science Lab general safety rules.</em></a>
<p>I think the reason why I chose this link is obvious, because Toby clearly needs to learn how to be safe in the lab.</p>
<a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/graphic-design-tips/tips-brainstorming-inspiration-12359-10"><em>Ways to brainstorm ideas</em></a>
<p>I chose this link because well, Toby can't get awesome ideas all the time, he must get writer's block one in a while. I found this link and hope that it will help him.</p>
<a href="https://spaceshipsandlaserbeams.com/18-fun-science-experiments-for-kids/"><em>Science experiments you can do at home.</em></a>
<p>Even though Toby is way ahead of us in science, and all the experiments listed in the link above are way to simple for Toby, I think he'll enjoy doing some of these when he has some spare time</p>
<a href="https://www.tripadvisor.ca/Restaurants-g155019-zfp3-Toronto_Ontario.html"><em>Top ten most romantic restaurants in Toronto</em>
<p>In the story, Toby adores a formor spy named Veronica Brooks. I think he might want to take her to one of these restaurants A.S.A.P.</p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"><em>Chemical substances</em></a>
<p>I think Toby will like this link because it defines the definition of a chemical substance, which might help him in his future creations.</p>

<img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51JHLz333eL._SY346_.jpg"width= 225 height= 375>
<h1>I was unable to find a picture of just Izumi, so in the same picture above, you already know Abby and Toby, so the black haired girl on the right side of Abby has to be Izumi.</h1>
<p>Izumi was also a science nerd and a great fighter, she was also hard to find website links for because I don't know much about her.</p>
<p>Again, I'm going to ask you not to click on the links unless you're the teacher, Thank You.</p>
<a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Block-Punches-in-Karate"><em>Quick Blocking moves</em></a>
<p>Even though Izumi is already a Black Belt in karate, I still think she will appreciate these tips.</p>
<a href="https://www.historians.org/about-aha-and-membership/aha-history-and-archives/historical-archives/why-study-history-(1998)"><em>Why study history?</em></a>
<p>History turns out to be Izumi's least favorite subject, so maybe this website will change her mind.</p>
<a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/57204/20-amazing-animal-adaptations-living-desert"><em>20 animal adaptations</em></a>
<p>Izumi loved learning about other species, so that is why I think she will enjoy this article.</p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izumi"><em>Izumi</em></a>
<p>Izumi's family is vey cultural, so if her grandmother ever tests her on what her name means, this site would come in handy. P.S. Izumi in Japanese means "fountain"</p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_table"><em>Periodic table</em></a>
<p>I think Izumi will enjoy this website because its quite helpful, and can maybe teach her a thing or two. (And it comes with a picture of it too!)</p>
