<img src= "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51JHLz333eL._SY346_.jpg">
<h2>Characters</h2>
<p>The characters I chose for my website are the five main characters the story focuses on. The story centers around Abigail Hunter, the daughter of Jennifer Hunter, one of the founders of the spy school.
The antagonist is Poppy Parsons, Mrs. Smith favors her and is willing to let Poppy into spy school early, causing Abby and her friends to be jealous.
Abby has three BFFs, Toby, Charlotte, and Izumi. I will be doing a page on this website on each of them separately.</p>

<h1>This is a picture of Abby.</h1>
<<p> Abby is a very consistent girl, she doesn't every give up. Even though Abby is somewhat clumsy and managed to break serveral spy phones, it isn't totally her fault. Abby is the Ghost and "Tinker Bells"
 number one target, making her very vulnerable. The Ghost and Tinker Bell are also enemies, they both want to control the world and be the most feared hacker on earth.</p>
 <p> It wasn't very difficult finding Abby five website links, as her personality is truly one of a kind. Below are the links to the websites, please don't click on the links(unless you are Mrs.Stoffberg 
 or Mr.Cupit). <strong>Thank you.</strong></p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature"><em>Nature</em></a>
<p>I chose this website on Nature because Abby loves the wild enviroment, and getting to know it; just like her mother.</p>
<a href="https://www.cariboutests.com/test/practice_test_login.php"><em>Caribou Contests</em></a>
<p>I chose this website because Abby loves math, it's her favorite subject in school.</p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis"><em>Cannabis</em></a>
<p>I think Abby would enjoy learning about Cannabalism beacuse she cares about others.</p>
<a href="https://www.tripadvisor.ca/Restaurant_Review-g154943-d3320819-Reviews-The_Notte_s_Bon_Ton_Bakery-Vancouver_British_Columbia.html"><em>Bon Ton Bakery Trip Advisor</em></a>
<p>Abby's a real foodie, so I think she will enjoy a visit to Bon Ton Bakery.</p>
<a href="https://www.thedailymeal.com/eat/10-best-all-you-can-eat-buffets-america"><em>14 Best Buffets</em></a>
<p>I think this is a good website for Abby because again. she loves food.</p>
