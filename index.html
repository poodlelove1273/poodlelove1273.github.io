<h1>Book: Mrs.Smith's Spy School<em> For Girls</em> Double Cross</h1>
<img src= "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51JHLz333eL._SY346_.jpg">
<h2>Characters</h2>
<p>The characters I chose for my website are the five main characters the story focuses on. The story centers around Abigail Hunter, the daughter of Jennifer Hunter, one of the founders of the spy school.
The antagonist is Poppy Parsons, Mrs. Smith favors her and is willing to let Poppy into spy school early, causing Abby and her friends to be jealous.
Abby has three BFFs, Toby, Charlotte, and Izumi. I will be doing a page on this website on each of them separately.</p>

<h1>This is a picture of Abby.</h1>
<p> Abby is a very consistent girl, she doesn't every give up. Even though Abby is somewhat clumsy and managed to break serveral spy phones, it isn't totally her fault. Abby is the Ghost and "Tinker Bells"
 number one target, making her very vulnerable. The Ghost and Tinker Bell are also enemies, they both want to control the world and be the most feared hacker on earth.</p>
 <p> It wasn't very difficult finding Abby five website links, as her personality is truly one of a kind. Below are the links to the websites, please don't click on the links(unless you are Mrs.Stoffberg 
 or Mr.Cupit). <strong>Thank you.</strong></p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature"><em>Nature</em></a>
<p>I chose this website on Nature because Abby loves the wild enviroment, and getting to know it; just like her mother.</p>
<a href="https://www.cariboutests.com/test/practice_test_login.php"><em>Caribou Contests</em></a>
<p>I chose this website because Abby loves math, it's her favorite subject in school.</p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis"><em>Cannabis</em></a>
<p>I think Abby would enjoy learning about Cannabalism beacuse she cares about others.</p>
<a href="https://www.tripadvisor.ca/Restaurant_Review-g154943-d3320819-Reviews-The_Notte_s_Bon_Ton_Bakery-Vancouver_British_Columbia.html"><em>Bon Ton Bakery Trip Advisor</em></a>
<p>Abby's a real foodie, so I think she will enjoy a visit to Bon Ton Bakery.</p>
<a href="https://www.thedailymeal.com/eat/10-best-all-you-can-eat-buffets-america"><em>14 Best Buffets</em></a>
<p>I think this is a good website for Abby because again. she loves food.</p>

<h1>Unfortunatly, I wasn't able to find a picture of Poppy. You are welcome to search it up yourself.</h1>
<p>Poppy was harder to find website links for as she had a more snobby personality. She was quite the genius and loved to plan. Poppy was the creater of Blackout, a device that can shut down electricity 
anywhere, anytime. Blackout was designed to stop people who annoy Poppy from doing so, but became a dangerous weapon. At first, Abby, Izumi, Charlotte, and Toby thought the Ghost was after Blackout, so they had
to work together with Poppy and tell her eveything to <strong><em>"Save the world."</em></strong></p>
<p>Again, I'm going to ask you not to click on the links unless you're the teacher, Thank You.</p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_awards"><em>Awards you can win</em></a>
<p>I chose this website because Poppy loved to earn rewards, she always wanted to make her parents proud.</p>
<a href="https://managementhelp.org/strategicplanning/index.htm"><em>Strategic Planning.</em></a>
<p>Poppy loves being organized and pays close attention to details. One thing she loves doing most is planning. I think she'll enjoy this website and maybe learn something from it.</p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"><em>Science.</em></a>
<p>As snobby as Poppy was, she was quite the nerd. Her favorite subject would be Science; and that's why I think Poppy would enjoy this link.</p>
<a href="https://list25.com/25-most-expensive-things-in-the-world/"><em>Top 25 most expensive things you can buy.</em></a>
<p>The reason I chose this link is because not only was Poppy smart, her parents were <em>really</em> rich. If Poppy got awarded with something, who knows how much cash she'll get!</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=new+viral+fashion+trends+2019"><em>New Viral Fashion Trends</em></a>
<p>I chose this link because Poppy always dressed up-to-date, so maybe these kinds of websites help her.</p>
